    <p>
      Here we come to a turning of the season--
      Witness to the arc towards the sun--
      The neighbors blessed burden, within reason--
      Becomes a burden borne of all in one--
      But nobody, nobody knows--
      Let the yoke fall from our shoulders--
      Don't carry it all, don't carry it all--
      We are all our hands in holders--
      Beneath this bold and brilliant sun--
      But this I swear to all--
      A monument to build beneath the arbors--
      Upon a cliff the that towers towards the trees--
      But every vessel pitching hard to starboard--
      Lay it's head on summers freckled knees--
      And nobody, nobody knows--
      Let the yoke fall from our shoulders--
      Don't carry it all don't carry it all--
      We are all our hands in holders--
      Beneath this bold and brilliant sun--
      This I swear to all, this I swear to all--
      Buried wreath of trillium and ivy--
      Laid upon the body of the boy--
      Lazy will the long come from it's hiding--
      Return his quiet certitude to the soil--
      So raise a glass to turnings of the season--
      And watch it as it arcs towards the sun--
      And you must bear your neighbor's burden within reason--
      And your labors will be borne when all is done--
      And nobody, nobody knows--
      Let the yoke fall from our shoulders--
      Don't carry it all don't carry it all--
      We are all our hands in holders--
      Beneath this bold and brilliant sun--
      And this I swear to all--
      And this I swear to all--
      And this I swear to all--
      To all, to all, to all
