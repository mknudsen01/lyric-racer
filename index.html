      I was left to my own devices--
      Many days fell away with nothing to show--
      And the walls kept tumbling down--
      In the city that we love--
      Great clouds roll over the hills--
      Bringing darkness from above--
      But if you close your eyes,--
      Does it almost feel like--
      Nothing changed at all?--
      And if you close your eyes,--
      Does it almost feel like--
      You've been here before?--
      How am I gonna be an optimist about this?--
      How am I gonna be an optimist about this?--
      We were caught up and lost in all of our vices--
      In your pose as the dust settled around us--
      And the walls kept tumbling down--
      In the city that we love--
      Great clouds roll over the hills--
      Bringing darkness from above--
      But if you close your eyes,--
      Does it almost feel like--
      Nothing changed at all?--
      And if you close your eyes,--
      Does it almost feel like--
      You've been here before?--
      How am I gonna be an optimist about this?--
      How am I gonna be an optimist about this?--
      Eh-eh-o eh-o [4x]--
      Oh where do we begin?--
      The rubble or our sins?--
      Oh oh where do we begin?--
      The rubble or our sins?--
      And the walls kept tumbling down (oh where do we begin?)--
      In the city that we love (the rubble or our sins?)--
      Great clouds roll over the hills (oh where do we begin?)--
      Bringing darkness from above (the rubble or our sins?)--
      But if you close your eyes,--
      Does it almost feel like--
      Nothing changed at all?--
      And if you close your eyes,--
