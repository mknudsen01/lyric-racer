    I sense a runner in the garden--
    Although my judgement's known to fail--
    Once built a steamboat in a meadow--
    'Cause I'd forgotten how to sail--
    I know the runner's going to tell you--
    There ain't no cowboy in my hair--
    So now he's buried by the daisies--
    So I could stay the tallest man--
    In your eyes, babe--
    I sense a spy up in the chimney--
    From all the evidence I've burned--
    I guess he'll read it in the smoke now--
    And soon to ashes I'll return--
    I know the spy is going to tell you--
    It's not my flag up in the pole--
    So now he's buried by the lilies--
    So I could stay forevermore--
    In your eyes, babe--
    I sense a leak inside my phone now--
    From all the lies that I have told--
    I know he has your private number--
    And soon he'll make that vicious call--
    I know the leak is going to tell you--
    There ain't no puppy in your leash--
    So now he'll fertilize the roses--
    So I could stay the king you see--
    In your eyes, babe--
    In your eyes, babe--
    So now we're dancing through the garden--
    And what a garden I have made--
    And now that death will grow my jasmine--
    I find it soothing I'm afraid--
    Now there is no need for suspicion--
    There ain't no fraud kissing your hand--
    I won't be lying when I tell you--
    That I'm a gardener I'm a man--
    In your eyes babe--
    In your eyes babe--
    In your eyes babe
